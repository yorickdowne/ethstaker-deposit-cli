class InteractiveProcess:
    '''
    Expect-style helper for running the CLI as a subprocess with piped stdin/stdout
    and simulating user interaction.

    Robustness properties compared to hand-rolled scraping:
    - every read and the exit wait are bounded by timeouts, so a missing prompt
      fails fast instead of hanging the whole test suite;
    - ANSI escape sequences are stripped before matching;
    - prompts are located by substring instead of exact line prefixes;
    - stderr is merged into stdout and all observed lines are kept in a
      transcript that is included in failure messages;
    - the exit code is asserted to be 0 by `wait()`;
    - the subprocess is killed if the test fails while it is still running.

    Only one interaction currently exists in the `--non_interactive` flows:
    the mnemonic retype `click.prompt`. The `click.pause()` calls in the CLI
    ("press any key", clipboard clearing) are no-ops and print nothing when
    stdin/stdout are not TTYs (verified against click's implementation), so
    they require no simulated input here.
